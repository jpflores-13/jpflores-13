* 🎓 I am a PhD student in the [Bioinformatics and Computational Biology (BCB)](https://bcb.unc.edu/) program at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.
* 🔬 I study the role of 3D chromatin structure in response to environmental stress in the [Phanstiel Lab](http://phanstiel-lab.med.unc.edu/).

Although science is what I want to do for the rest of my career, I am extremely passionate about diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) and empowering the next generation of scientists.

Check out my DEI literature dashboard (in construction) and my podcast, _From where does it STEM?_
